# Getting Started

The Old Gods' Engine reads Tiled map editor files in JSON format.
[Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) is a free and open source map editor. It's
tops. Now go download it. Feel free to donate, the developer does good work.

After downloading Tiled take a moment to read
[the Tiled documentation](https://doc.mapeditor.org/en/stable/). There are also
very good youtube videos explaining its features and how to use them.
