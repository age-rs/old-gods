Welcome, user! Thank you for picking up a copy of the Old Gods' Engine! The OG
Engine is a tool for creating retro style 2d games. It aims to be easy to use and
extend, but its purpose is yet to be set in stone. Indeed, like a troll at
midnight this engine jumps around a lot, but the sun must rise eventually.

In this book we'll go over how to use the OG Engine for maximum profit or
vengeance, the choice is yours ;)
